//  Here 's how you can implement the single inheritance scenario with C#:

//  We have a namespace Farm that contains classes Animal, Dog, and StartUp.
//  Animal class has a single public method Eat() which prints "eating...".
//  Dog class inherits from Animal using the : operator. It has a single public method Bark() which prints "barking...".
//  StartUp class contains the Main() method which creates an instance of Dog and calls its Bark() method twice.
