/* Your code appears to be a C# program that reads input from the console to create a list of Student objects with properties such as FirstName, LastName, Age, and City. Then, it prompts the user to input a city name and prints out the details of students who belong to that city.
Here's how your program works:
It creates a list called person to store Student objects.
It reads input from the console until the user types "end".
For each line of input, it splits the line into an array of strings using spaces as separators.
It creates a new Student object and initializes its properties using the parsed values from the input array.
It adds the newly created Student object to the person list.
After the user types "end", it reads another input, assuming it's a city name.
It iterates over the person list and prints out the details of students who belong to the entered city.
Your code looks well-structured and does what you described. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
