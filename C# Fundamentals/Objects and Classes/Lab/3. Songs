/* Your C# code looks good! It seems to be a program that manages a list of songs, where each song has a type, name, and time. It then allows users to filter and display songs based on their type.

Here's a quick rundown of what the code does:

    It defines a Song class with properties for the type of the song, the name of the song, and the time of the song.
    In the Main method, it initializes an empty list of Song objects.
    It reads an integer from the console, representing the number of songs to be added.
    It loops numSongs times, reading input from the console for each song, splitting it into its components (type, name, and time), creating a Song object, and adding it to the list of songs.
    It reads a string from the console, representing the type of songs to display.
    If the input is "all", it prints the name of all songs. Otherwise, it prints the name of songs that match the given type.

Overall, your code is well-structured and easy to understand. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
